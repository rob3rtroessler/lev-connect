I've presented my work at various poster and oral presentations prior to graduating. I also wrote a thesis on the neural circuitry of fear and context discrimination.

Currently, my research has shifted to a clinical nature. I am conducting a series of studies examining the outcomes of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures in order to determine how we can reduce the morbidity and mortality of the deadly diseases these patients face.
